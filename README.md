Doogie
======

Overview
--------
Growing up, I watched Doogie Howser, MD. I watched him writing 
his journal entries in a simple text editor and saving them
at the end of every episode. doogie.py is an attempt to bring
back the simplicity of writing blog/journal entries while at 
the same time allowing me to write them in a simplified format
such as markdown in my favorite editor vim.

Requirements
------------

Doogie requires two non-standard libraries to function:
python-markdown
http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/

Google Data Python library
http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/python_client_lib.html#library

Suggested Use
-------------

Git is configured to ignore the entries/ directory. I've setup a separate
Git repository that houses my entries within the entries directory. Doogie
will handle git commits for you (eventually).
