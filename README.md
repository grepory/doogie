Doogie
======

Growing up, I watched Doogie Howser, MD. I watched him writing 
his journal entries in a simple text editor and saving them
at the end of every episode. doogie.py is an attempt to bring
back the simplicity of writing blog/journal entries while at 
the same time allowing me to write them in a simplified format
such as markdown in my favorite editor vim.
